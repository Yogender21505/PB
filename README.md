# Prediction of Breast Cancer Survival Rate 
## Problem Statement
Breast cancer is a common problem 
among women worldwide and early 
detection and treatment are essential 
for improving survival rates. 
However, there are limited resources 
that can accurately predict a 
patient's survivability rate.
## SOLUTION
We propose to develop a 
bioinformatics tool that can predict 
breast cancer survivability rate by 
integrating omics data. We will use 
exploratory data analysis to identify 
the most important features for 
predicting survivability rate, and we 
will develop machine-learning models 
to train the tool.
## Prediction Model
We have implemented Decision Tree Regression model to predict the survivability 
rate of patient on the basis of their age, time recurrence and the therapies they went 
through.
Introduction the Decision Tree Regression model:
A decision tree regression model is a type of machine learning model that can be 
used to predict a continuous value, such as the survivability rate of a patient. The 
model works by creating a tree-like structure of decisions, where each decision is 
based on a feature of the data. The model then uses the values of the features to 
make predictions for the target value.
The features used in the model are:
* Age: The age of the patient at the time of diagnosis.
* TimeRecurrence: The time in months from diagnosis to recurrence.
* Chemo(0/1): Whether the patient received chemotherapy.
* Hormonal(0/1): Whether the patient received hormonal therapy.
* Amputation(0/1): Whether the patient had an amputation.
* HistType(1,2,4,5,7): The histological type of the tumor.
